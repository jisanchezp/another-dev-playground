## Description

This is a personal project. Guided by curiosity and creativity.

Everyone is welcome fork this repository and create your own freestyle coding camp

More hands-on, less planning, create!

The only Coder Requirement (ToCR) is: Minimum 1 commit a day! Just 1. 0 plus 1. OMG!

Each day commit count == 0, player loses 1 commitment point. :(

Commitment Ratio will be calculated as: 
* Days in Year: 

    Year MOD 4 != 0
        return 365;
    Year 
        return 366 -- [Leap year]
        
        
* Comitment Points default value: 

    * Value set after first commit.
    * Sequential Day of current year: X, X e [1, 365 | 366]

* Ratio: Commitment Points / DaysInAYear / ())
